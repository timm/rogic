MMeemmooss

    Memoing with inconsistency checking.

    Each memo is a pair "Key=Value". If the program generates a completely
    new "Value" for "Key", then it is stored.

    If the program stumbles on another "Value" for "Key", then this code
    will reject the new "Value" if contradicts the older known "Value".

    At anytime, the program can ask for the current "value".

    Internally, the "Key=Value" pairs are stored as "assumption"s since if
    the program backtracks over memo creation, the "Value" is thrown away.
    That is, all memos are tentative and can be discarded if that proves
    useful.
