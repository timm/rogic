 {\PROD} can be used to
  {\em document} or {\em deliver}
 a Prolog application:

 \bd
 \item[Delivery:]
 The current {\PROD} distribution comes with a set of standard Prolog applications
  shown
in \fig{components}. These programs are written in
the {\em {\PROD}-compatible file convention} (described in \tion{prodcompat})
which
 simplifies using
Prolog code from different programmers. {\PROD} files are valid
Prolog code that can be loaded into a Prolog interpreter, without
modification.
 \item[Documentation:]A {\PROD} file also
  contains{\LaTeX} commands inside Prolog's comment
characters; i.e. on a line after the {\tt \%} character or between
 {$\backslash$}{\tt *}...{\tt *}{$\backslash$} characters.
 That is, as a programmer
 writes their code  they can add in comments which,
 subsequently, can be typeset.
\ed

The typeset form of a {\PROD} document looks just like this
document and includes a table of contents; a list of figures;
automatic numbering of sections, figures, and citations. Also, all
the Prolog code is displayed as verbatim text (in a {\tt
typewriter font}).

{\PROD} is distributed under the GNU General Public License. Every
{\PROD} document automatically includes that license as part of
its appendix.

\fig{proddocuments}, at the end of this document, lists other

\subsection{Inside a {\PROD} file}

\fig{prod0sample} shows a sample {\PROD} file. When typeset,
{\LaTeX} converts this document to the PDF file shown at
\url{http://tim.menzies.com/pdf/prod0.pdf}. This file contains a
{\em header}, a {\em preamble}, a {\em body}, and a {\em footer}.

\subsubsection{The header and footer}

A {\PROD} file begins with a standard {\em header}:

{\scriptsize \begin{verbatim}
/*\documentclass[twocolumn,global]{svjour}
\usepackage{prod}\begin{document}
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent which starts a {\LaTeX} document and loads the {\tt
prod.sty} style file. The file also ends with a standard {\em
footer}:

{\scriptsize \begin{verbatim}
/*
\theend
\end{document}
*/
\end{verbatim}}





\subsubsection{The Premable}

In between the footer and the header there is a
{\em preamble} and a {\em body}.
The preamble defines
certain key parameters of the file using the following commands.
 For a detailed example of the use of these commands,
see \fig{samplepreamble}.

\bd
\item[{\tt $\backslash$theprogram\{NAME\}}]: Defines the {\tt NAME} of the program
being described. I use very short names for my programs (less than 3 letters).
\item[{\tt $\backslash$thetocdepth\{LEVEL\}}]: Controls how detailed is the table of contents.
A {\tt LEVEL=N}, the table of contents only includes down to level {\tt N}. For very short
tables of contents, use {\tt N=1}.
\item[{\tt $\backslash$theref\{FILE\}}]:
Shows the location of the file {\tt FILE.bib} which
contains
the citations
for this file.
For those not familiar with {\LaTeX}'s citation system, \fig{bib} shows a sample
of the {\tt refs.bib} database.
\item[{\tt $\backslash$thewp\{PATHNAME\}}]: Shows where to find the source code file
for this document.
\item[{\tt $\backslash$thetitle\{TITLE\}}]: Defines the {\tt TITLE} of the paper.
\item[{\tt $\backslash$theauthor\{AUTHOR1 $\backslash$inst\{1\},
                                   AUTHOR2{\tt $\backslash$inst\{2\}}\}}]:
Defines the {\tt AUTHOR}s and maps those authors to their {\tt INSTITUTIONS}.
\item[{\tt $\backslash$theinstitute\{WORK PLACE\}}]: Defines where the {\tt AUTHOR}s
work.
Multiple {\tt INSTITUTIONS} are separated by ``$\backslash${\tt and}''.
\item[{\tt $\backslash$thereference\{REFERENCE\}}]: Where this paper appears and where it
can it be downloaded from.
\item[{\tt $\backslash$theacknowledgement\{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\}}]: Credit given where credit is due.
\item[{\tt $\backslash$theabstract\{ONE PARAGRAPH SUMMARY\}}]: A short summary of the paper.
\ed

Some of the above commands can be entered in a different order
but, for safety's sake, it is best to use the above ordering for
the preamble.

\subsubsection{The Body}

The {\em body} of a {\PROD} file contains Prolog source code
embedded in {\LaTeX} commands. Within the body, the
following conventions
hold:

\bi  \item Anything found between {\tt \%<} and {\tt \%>} is
preserved as verbatim text (e.g. see lines 44 to 48 of
\fig{prod0sample}).  \item A line starting with {\tt
\%{$\backslash$}command} is converted to {\tt
{$\backslash$}command} (e.g. line 25 of \fig{prod0sample}). \item
A {\em level 1 heading} is declared for text found after {\tt
\%\%\%\%} (e.g. line 37 of \fig{prod0sample}).
 \item A {\em level 2 heading} is declared for text
found after {\tt \%\%\%} (e.g. line 31 of \fig{prod0sample}).
 \item A {\em level 3 heading} is declared for text
found after {\tt \%\%} (e.g. line 34 of \fig{prod0sample}).
 \ei

In the case of level 1,2,3  headings:
\bi \item There can be no characters to the left of the comment
characters. \item If the line ends in {\tt \%<}, then the heading
is declared and verbatim text starts straight after the heading.
\ei

Currently, {\PROD} does not support headings levels greater than
3.
