\section{Who?}

{\PROD} emerged after many years of programming. I list here some
of the people who, along the way, most influenced my thinking.
These credits are listed alphabetically by main handle; e.g. last
name or web site title.


\bd

\item[Graham Mann:] who always challenges me to reach further.

\item[ Numerous grad students:] who always stared at me funny when
I confused them, forcing me to say it again, better, simpler, more
clearer. Special mention to: \bi \item Eliza Chaing \item Lindsay
Mason \ei

\item[David Poole:] David was the first to show me the the trick
of adding {\LaTeX} command into a Prolog program. He also ``lead
from the front'' by writing some of the most   elegant Prolog I
have ever seen~\cite{poole98}.

\item[Claude Sammut:] who I believed, all those years ago,  when
he said that Prolog can be used for real world applications. For
my masters back in the 1980s, he asked me to write a ``good''
Prolog expert system shell. Well, Claude, I've nearly got it right
so I hope you'll give me a passing grade.

\item[Roland Sammut and Michael Wise:] who originally taught me
Prolog.

The following people have never meet me, probably don't know my
name, or my face. But I always sought to rise to their
exceptionally high standards:

\bd

\item[Peter Norvig:] whose {\em Paradigms of Artificial
Intelligence} is an inspiration to all educators.

\item[Guy L. Steele:] The man who wrote two of the greatest
technical documents in the world: {\em Common Lisp, the Language}
and {\em The Hacker's Dictionary}.  Any man who writes a PhD
thesis where the font sizes change twenty times in a single
sentence is my kind of Guy (I've been waiting decades to make that
joke...). \ed
