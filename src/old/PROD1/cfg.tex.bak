\theabstract{CFG lets programmers and users
defined a set of options using the syntax
\[
option = setting
\]
For application $X$, the options can be placed
in
\bi
\item
A default setting files called $defaults.X$.
\item
A user preference file called $config.X$.
\item
Or, on the command line.
\ei Options in files have be followed by a
full stop ``. ''. Options on the command line
have to be followed by a space.
CFG loads settings in the order $defaults.X$,
	$config.X$, then command line.
If the samle option is seen more than once during
this load, then the {\em latest} option overrides
all the older ones. That is, command-line options
override $config.X$ options which override $defaults.X$
options.
