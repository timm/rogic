Changes to HT4 source code
--------------------------

Additions to the definition of "t" in io.pl have been made.

Commented out section of "editRule" and most of "compileObservations1" due to
conflicts with newer SWI-Prolog compiler.  The former not needed as it deals
with ablers, the latter not required as a different observation compiler is
used.  Code is in shdilect.pl.

Also fSweepNumbers in shmain.pl changed to remove ">" symbols and replace with
"," to solve the above problem again.

Addition of clause to shdemos.pl ":- discontiguous demo/1."

Currently not making modifications to Tim's code beyond above.
