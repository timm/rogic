\be
\item Fonts are a problem. If I use the standard Computer Modern
font, the preview looks bad on the web. But if I use Times, then
sometimes I get funny {\bf fi} characters in the font. So, for now, I
use Times in order to get decent web previews.
\item
The curly brackets used by DCGs are a problem. {\PROD} deletes those
brackets because they look like {\LaTeX} stuff. So, for  DCG r{\PROD} code,
curly-brackets are replaced by a prefix {\tt ><} character.
