\section{Motivations}

Computer development systems can be divided up according to what
they are trying to do. Systems based on ``C'' are usually
optimized to {\em run} fast. Systems based on some normalized
database design are optimized to be {\em maintained} quickly. And
systems written in high-level languages are usually the ones where
programs can be {\em written} quickly.

This characterization of systems into ``fast to run'' or ``fast to
maintain'' or ``fast to write'' is, of course, only an
approximation. Clearly, these kinds of systems can be combined so
that (e.g.) systems written in high-level languages can be quickly
written then compiled to ``C'' so they run fast. Nevertheless, the
emphasis in most programming courses is on procedural programs in
languages such as ``C'' programming. This has the side-effect that
most programmers never see how much of their work is influenced by
the ``fast to run'' approach. As standard desktop machines get
faster, it becomes practical to move beyond the ``fast to run''
paradigm.

So...

\subsection{Must show software}

Erwin Schroedinger once said {\em if you cannot- in the long run-
tell everyone what you have been doing, your doing has been
worthless.} Well, it took me a while to work it out but finally I
realized that as a software engineering educator, I should be
presenting software to my classes. Every class, lots of software.

I've tried various languages and various formats and this is my latest attempt. In
this experiment, the new  mix is:



 \bi \item

The programming language is
Prolog~\cite{der96,me89zb,bratko01,ok90,sterling94}) since, for me
anyway,  it lets me show the most functionality in the fewest lines.

\item

The examples are biased towards logic-for- software-engineering
\ldots

\item

\dots coded up in a programming style not discussed extensively in
the standard Prolog texts {\ldots}

\item {\ldots} presented in a very hands-on programming style. \ei

Also, I can't convince anyone that Prolog is pretty good without
pretty good documentation. {\PROD} is a bunch of {\LaTeX} tricks that
let me rapidly generate camera-ready documents from my Prolog code.

Maybe you'll
find it useful as a programming or teaching resource.

\subsection{My Programming Style}

Just so you know: I
use a non-standard programming style which, in my view,
is not adequately covered in the Prolog texts:

\bi
\item



Ugly Prolog syntax is hidden away using operators (my motto: ``death to brackets'' (sorry about
the brackets in this sentence, but I didn't design English)).

\item

Extensive used of named fields within terms.

\item

Extensive use of DCGs to carry around
and update a model.

\item

A lot of load-time pre-processing.

\item

Compiling different representations into horn clauses, then writing
general meta-interpreters for those clauses.

\item

Stochastic inference.


\ei



\subsection{ But why are you still using Prolog?}

Well, it's like this. As long as:

\bi


\item

I want to write state-of-the-art model-based software.

\item

I can keep up with the next generation of grad student programmers.

\item

I don't have unlimited programming time.

\item

There is a large international community of educators, researchers and vendors
supplying high quality Prolog materials.

\ei

\noindent
then, I'll stay with Prolog.  Here's my reasons:

Prolog endures. It is an old language (1972) yet it keeps being taught, keeps being used industrially,  and high-quality textbooks and interpreters are readily available.
Nevertheless,
like many folk, I used Prolog in grad school then left it behind for something better.
``Prolog?'',
I used to say, ``that was something we used to do as kids''.

Only
thing was, the ``something better'' wasn't so much better. After nearly a decade  of real-world
commercial programming in Prolog, then Lisp, then Smalltalk, I realized
that my best logic programming code was smaller than my best functional or OO code.
This was a surprise since I thought that (e.g.) OO would allow me to better structure my programs. (Actually, I stopped thinking that when I discovered the wonderfully messy and practical Perl programming language.
Heck, my Prolog has to be at least as well structured as the average Perl program.)


Anyway, then I became an academic again and I noticed a couple of things. Firstly,
the machines were getting faster. It is now perfectly viable to deliver interpreted systems in a commercial setting
(look at all the Perl code out there).

While the machines get faster, I seem to be getting slower. I kept finding that I
didn't have time to write huge programs.
I had to return to my Prolog in order to get certain jobs done.

Slow as I was, I found that I could still out-program my
grad students.
See, I'd thrash around for a weekend
in Prolog and then give it to them saying ``code it in C, make it faster,
make it better''. Trouble was, months later, they were still fighting their way through memory
leaks, pointer problems, etc.

Another reason for staying with Prolog is that,
at least in my view,  logic programming techniques are being used more and more.
For example, the reflection pattern proposed by OO design gurus (and implemented as e.g.
Java beans or aspect-oriented programming)
is just programmers realizing that things like {\tt clause/2} is astonishingly useful. But this is
just a special case of my next point.

Old-fashioned software is like obsessed over-trained athlete sprinting for the finish line.
Such software
runs fast since it doesn't look where it is going. But, it  will
stumble and crash at the first  hole in the road.
Modern model-based
software builds and reflects over some model carefully crafted at runtime. Choices are recognized,
and processed  via an on-going  analysis of the internal model.
Prolog is just  terrific for implementing
such reflection- 20 lines of meta-interpretation can give you soooo much.

Q.E.D.







\subsection{Some Credits}

(These credits are  listed
alphabetically by main handle; e.g. last name or web site title:)

I have
drawn much inspiration from
many  folks over the years.
So, some of these go waaay back:

\bd


\item[Graham Mann:]
who always challenges me to reach further.

\item[ Numerous grad students:]
who always stared at me funny when I confused them, forcing
me to say it again, better, simpler, more clearer. Special mention to:
\bi
\item Eliza Chaing
\item Lindsay Mason
\ei


\item[Claude Sammut:] who I believed, all those years ago,  when he
said that Prolog can be used for real world applications. For my
masters back in the 1980s, he asked me to write a ``good'' Prolog
expert system shell. Well, Claude, I've nearly got it right so I hope
you'll give me a passing grade.

\item[Roland Sammut and Michael Wise:]
who originally taught
me Prolog.

\ed

The following people have never meet me, probably don't know my name, or my
face. But I always sought to rise to their
exceptionally high standards:

\bd

\item[Peter Norvig:]
whose {\em Paradigms of Artificial
Intelligence} is an inspiration to all educators.

\item[Guy L. Steele:]
The man who wrote two of the greatest
technical documents in the world: {\em Common Lisp, the Language} and
{\em The Hacker's Dictionary}.  Any man who writes a PhD thesis where
the font sizes change twenty times in a single sentence is my kind of
Guy (I've been waiting decades to make that joke...).
