dont test for NCHANGES candidate til you find a smaller one first

A3           1         1.05     1,2,3    1.135   nchanges > 1 cancelled- too long
B3           8         1.25     1,2      1.32    nchanges =2 ran ok
C3           12        1.3      3        1.57    to run nchanges=3, needed fewer CANDIDATES 
                                                so PROMISING set to 12
                                                LESSON: to increase NCHANGES, need larger PROMISING
