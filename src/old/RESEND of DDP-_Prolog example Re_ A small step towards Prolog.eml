Tim,
         I dug up the message from a month-and-a-half ago with the small 
example.
Presumably if we debug this and get it working, then I can dump on you the 
BIG example...
Martin


Tim,
         In response to what was discussed this week, please find attached 
a .txt file in something close to the format you last asked for.

There are a couple of places I'm not sure I followed your instructions 
correctly:
1) You had indicated that for the Weight field:
         0 except for leaves for everyone except pacts (which are 1)
     but the example you provided had a "_" symbol in the +r(r5,_,... line,
     and a 0 in the pact +p(p1,0,0.5,... line
2) You had indicated that for the Cost field:
         set to 1 if a pact set to 0 otherwise
    but since I now have put in some different cost figures for different 
PACTs,
    I put in whatever actual cost figure the PACT has (whihc in my example 
are 1,10 and 100 for the three different PACTs).

Finally, in answer to your question:

the penultimate item of an impact, e.g., for
+impact(f(13),r(11),0.1,v1).
the penultimate item is 0.1,
means that IF the failure mode f(13) occurs, then it will cause the loss
of that proportion (0.1) of requirement r(11).

and the penultimate item of an effect, e.g., for
+effect(f(13),p(16),0.11,v1).
the penultimate item is 0.11,
means that IF the failure mode f(13) is mitigated by the application of 
that pact p(16), then
that PACT will filter out that proportion (0.11) of the instances of that 
failure mode
(e.g., a perfect PACT would have an effect value of 1, meaning it filters 
out ALL instances;
a useless PACT would have an effect value of 0, meaning it does nothing to 
help filter
out instances of that FailureMode).

Hope that all makes sense,
do let me know of further needed changes!
Martin
