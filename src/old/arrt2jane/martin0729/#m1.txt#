Tim,

        Steve Cornford may be at the same out-of-town meeting that I
am attending, in which case he would not be able to listen in on the
Wed. morning teleconference either.  Do you have the time and
inclination to teleconference and tell us your approach in detail on,
say, Thursday or Friday (Aug 2nd or Aug 3rd)?

OK, back to work: I'm doubtful I correctly interpreted the second
formatting change you described. I think I understood and implemented
the other ones (1 and 3) OK.

I am attaching two files:

tiny.txt is a TIMMified (Translated Into Menzies Mumbojumbo) project
consisting of just a simple tree of requirements (no FMs, PACTs,
Impacts or Effects).  In DDP, the tree looks something like:

Get to Mars
        Launch into Earth orbit
        Earth orbit to Mars orbit
        Land from Mars orbit

and Launch... has weight 10, Earth... has weight 20, and Land... has weight 30.


finalTIG_Holo1_Access97.txt is much much larger, and is the file Julia
has been using to exercise the genetic algorithm (PACTs have costs,
not necessarily costs that bear any relationship to reality, but
sufficient to test the optimization algorithms!).  Duh, I forgot to
ask Julia what cost level she optimized to (I think I remember that
she held the sum total of PACTs to at or below some ceiling, and
sought the minimal risk [i.e., maximal requirement] solution, but I
forgot to ask her what the cost ceiling was!

Below, the fragment of your reformatting instructions that I didn't completely understand:
-------------------------------------

2) different default faults. before, for leaf requirements, we used to
say X,Y for args 2,3
 
+r(r10,1,1,0,v1). % OLD
 
now, say X,0 for args 2 and 3. e.g.
 
+r(r1,  10, 0,0,v1). % NEW: third argument is zero
 
also, for non-leaf requirements, we used to say 0,X for args 2,3 e.g.
 
+r(r9,0,1,0,v1) :- r(11),r(12).
 
now, we say X,0, e.g.
 
+r9(1,0,0,v1) :- r(11), r(12).
-------------------------------------

G'night!
Martin

hey martin,
 
once again, i can't attend the teleconference. 1000 apologies. every
week is a different excuse and this time i am on some hiring committee
for an IT support person. in my absence, here are some slides on the
ASE submission. let me know if you want a time when i walk through
them with you and any interested jpl folks.
 
now that i can reproduce the calcs you sent me before, i want to get
my senstiometer/optimiser to you.
 
you will need a machine with:
 
1) cygwin installed (see http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/download.html)
 
2) swi prolog installed (from http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/cgi-bin//nph-download/SWI-Prolog/w32pl409.exe)
 
3) tar2 installed (attached- but this is the same as what i sent you last week).
 
also, some minor changes to the export file for arrt. let me know if you can make these
changes in your routines or if i should write a conversion utility:
 
=================
export file changes:
 
1) my code assumes that there exists some special root requirement called "goal" which is above
all other things. and so i added some terms:
 
+aka(goal,"goal",v1).
 
+r(goal,1,  0,0,v1) :- r1.
+r(r1,  10, 0,0,v1).
 
the above example assumes that we have only one requirement (r1)
 
2) different default faults. before, for leaf requirements, we used to say X,Y for args
2,3
 
+r(r10,1,1,0,v1). % OLD
 
now, say X,0 for args 2 and 3. e.g.
 
+r(r1,  10, 0,0,v1). % NEW: third argument is zero
 
also, for non-leaf requirements, we used to say 0,X for args 2,3 e.g.
 
+r(r9,0,1,0,v1) :- r(11),r(12).
 
now, we say X,0, e.g.
 
+r9(1,0,0,v1) :- r(11), r(12).
 
3) few brackets. before we used to say things like
 
r(11)
r(12)
f(12)
p(10)
 
now we say
r11
r12
f12
p10
 
================
 
assuming you or i make these changes, then the next thing would be for us to try an interesting example. suggest you send something to me, i debug it up here, then we see if  the code down there with you can work the same way.
