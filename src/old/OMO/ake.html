<h1><a name="abudctive_knowledge_engineering">Abudctive Knowledge Engineering</a></h1>
<p>Abductive knowledge engineering (AKE) is an experiment in building
simpler tools for knowledge engineering.</p>
<p>AKE exploits a
phenomenum seen in many domains; i.e. very often a small number
of <em>funnel</em> variables appear in all useful solutions.
The metaphor here is that while software can shoot off in any direction,
eventually all paths seem to run down through
the same narrow funnel.</p>
<p>This funnel
phenomeunm has been called many things in many domains  such as:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
Pareto's 80/20 rule (most of the solution can be found
with just a little effort);
<p></p>
<li></li>
<a href="#item_crawford94">master-slave variables</a> in scheduling;
<p></p>
<li></li>
feature subset selection in data mining
<p></p>
<li></li>
backbones in <a href="#item_parkes99">constraint satisfaction problems</a>;
<p></p>
<li></li>
the minimal environments of the <a href="#item_dekleer86">ATMS</a>;
<p></p>
<li></li>
the base controversial assumptions of <a href="#item_me03c">HT4</a>.
<p></p></ul>
<p>Whatever the name, the core intuition is the same:
what happens in the total space of a program
is controlled by a small critical region within the
program. If so, then it is possible that
complete and complex
methods for software development and execution may be overkill.</p>
<p>AKE is both the test and the application of this possibility.
All its mechanisms assume that finding a few
funnel variables is enough to control a device.</p>
<p>There is a slow way and a fast way to
find the funnel. For example, computing
the base controversial assumptions of HT4 is theoretically
<a href="#item_me03c">NP-hard</a> and, in practice, HT4 ran in time exponential
on model size.
However, if the funnels control the
search space, then we need not seek the funnel: they will
find us. <em>Any</em> stochastically selected pathway to goals
must pass through the funnel (by definition). That is,
repeated application of some fast stochastic search
technique will stumble across the key controlling
variables 
(providing that search technique reaches the goals).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="welcome_to_the_knowledge_level">Welcome to the Knowledge Level</a></h2>
<p>In Newell's Knowledge Level (KL) approach, intelligence is modeled as a search for
appropriate <em>operators</em> that convert some <em>current state</em> to a
<em>goal state</em>. Domain-specific knowledge as used to select the
operators according to <em>the principle of rationality</em>; i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
An
intelligent agent will select an operator which its knowledge tells it
will lead the achievement of some of its goals.
<p></p></ul>
<p>If implemented, this
KL is built on top of a <em>symbol-level</em> containing data structures,
algorithms, etc. However, to a KL agent, these sub-cognitive
symbol-level constructs are the tools used ``sub-consciously'' as it
performs its KL processing [<a href="#item_newell82">Newell82</a>].</p>
<p>Newell's subsequent exploration of the KL lead to a general rule-based
language called SOAR [<em>Rosen93</em>] which was the basis for the
problem-space computational model (PSCM) [<a href="#item_yost89">Yost89</a>]. Programming
SOAR using the PSCM involves the consideration of multiple, nested
problem spaces.  Whenever a ``don't know what to do'' state is
reached, a new <em>problem space</em> is forked to solve that problem. Newell
concluded that the PSCM was the bridge between SOAR and true KL
modeling [<a href="#item_newell91">Newell91</a>,<a href="#item_newell93">Newell93</a>].</p>
